Simple RPG turn-based battle mechanic. This is a little project where I will be updating it as I work through materials and practice new techniques.


What you need to know!!
1. When running, the program runs in a browser loop.
2. While running, it is best to have the console open in your browser. Thats how you know what's going on!
3. Upon page load, the program will automatically begin. The run() function is what kicks it all off.
4. Calling run() in the console after the program has stopped will resume it.
5. To cancel, simply type "Cancel" in the prompt box. This will end the loop.
6. Resetting is handled by refreshing the page. This is done with reset() in the console, or hitting refresh in your browser.
